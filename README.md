> Simple_NN accomplished following basic NN s, for gettting familiar with tensorflow DAG.
>
> ***Caution***: Dataset is MNIST from Kaggle Digit Recognizer, not same with keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
>
> (In ipynb file there's a keras.datasets.fashion_mnist example)
>
> * One-hot MNIST dataset for 1 layer NN using basic Graident Optimizer
> * 5 hidden-layer NN with 100 epochs and Adam optimizer 
> * CNN: 3 conv-layer with two maxpooling + full-connected(dense)
>   * Tuning: learning rate should better less than 0.001, batch-size=50, nepochs=50/100
>   * **plots** directory stores several tuning result.
